**Sample Spring MVC Project with JDBC and JSP**

This is a sample project developed as part of learning Spring MVC framework. It demonstrates how to set up a basic Spring MVC application that utilizes JDBC for database connectivity and JSP for the front-end view.

**Features:**
- Implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
- Uses Spring MVC to handle HTTP requests and map them to appropriate controllers.
- Utilizes JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for interacting with a database.
- Incorporates JSP (JavaServer Pages) for generating dynamic HTML views.
- Demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JDBC.
- Provides a simple user interface for registering, updating, selecting, and deleting records.

This project aims to serve as a starting point for learning Spring MVC, JDBC, and JSP integration. It showcases how to build a web application with a database backend and provides an understanding of key concepts related to Spring MVC development.

Please note that this is a sample project intended for learning purposes and may not adhere to all best practices or include advanced features. It is meant to serve as a foundation for further exploration and experimentation in Spring MVC development.

Steps to create a Spring MVC project with Maven, JSP, and Spring JDBC dependencies, using MySQL as the database:

a. Create a Maven project with dependencies:
   1. Set up your development environment by installing the JDK and an IDE like Eclipse or STS.
   2. Create a new Maven project using the IDE 
   3. In the project's `pom.xml` file, add the necessary dependencies:
      - Spring MVC: This includes the `spring-webmvc` and `spring-context` dependencies.
      - JSP and JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library): These dependencies allow you to use JSP files and tag libraries.
      - Spring JDBC: Include the `spring-jdbc` dependency for interacting with the database.
      - MySQL Connector/J: Add the MySQL JDBC driver dependency to connect to the MySQL database.

b. Create form files:
   1. Inside the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp` folder, create JSP files that will contain the forms.
   2. Design the forms using HTML and JSP tags to collect user input, such as registration details.

c. Create `spring-servlet.xml` configuration file:
   1. Create a new XML file named `spring-servlet.xml`.
   2. Configure the view resolver bean to specify how the views should be resolved and rendered. For JSP views, I am using the `InternalResourceViewResolver` and set appropriate prefixes and suffixes.

d. Create `web.xml` file:
   1. Create a new XML file named `web.xml` in the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF` folder.
   2. Configure the `DispatcherServlet`, the main servlet provided by Spring MVC, to handle all incoming requests.
   3. Define the servlet mapping to map URLs to the `DispatcherServlet`.

e. Create controllers using `@Controller`:
   1. Create Java classes for your controllers, and annotate them with `@Controller`.
   2. Implement methods to handle specific requests. For example, create a method to handle registration requests using `@RequestMapping("/register")`.
   3. Use `@Autowired` to inject dependencies like the `JdbcTemplate` or other services.

f. Define URL mappings and JDBC usage:
   1. In your controller methods, define the logic for processing the requests and storing data in the database.
   2. Use the `JdbcTemplate` (provided by Spring JDBC) to interact with the database.
   3. For example, in the registration controller method, extract form data, validate it, and use the `JdbcTemplate` to insert the data into the MySQL `emp` table.
